Paste your OpenAI API key in a file named `gpt_api_key.txt` and keep it out of version control.
The CLI demo reads that file (or the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable) before each GPT call.
This repository is not a git project, but if you do commit it somewhere, add `gpt_api_key.txt` to `.gitignore`.
